// Now this data needs to be pushed to the cities array
// but the problem would be this would cities.push would push the data into a single index of a Array 
// cities.push(data) would be not a suitable option 
// here the length would be 1 and the 1st index size would be 1000
// so to avoid this spread operator is used so this would spread the main array into 1000 length
